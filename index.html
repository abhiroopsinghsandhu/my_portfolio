### 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Abhiroop Singh Sandhu**, a passionate and results-driven **Data Analyst** based in Vancouver, BC. With a Post-Baccalaureate Diploma in Business Analytics and hands-on experience in SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and R, I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights that drive decision-making.

Over the past few years, I've completed projects with **Accenture North America** and **PwC Switzerland**, where I developed interactive dashboards, analyzed complex datasets, and delivered executive-level presentations. Whether it’s exploring global health trends, optimizing education strategies, or visualizing telecom KPIs, I love uncovering stories hidden within data.

I bring a unique blend of **technical expertise**, **business acumen**, and **clear communication**, backed by a Dean’s List honor and real-world experience in both corporate and educational settings.

Let’s connect—I'm always excited about using data to solve real problems and make a meaningful impact.
